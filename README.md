Project description in English goes here.

## Project Description:
An interactive, low-level programming project implemented entirely in C, featuring modular architecture, dynamic memory management, robust error handling, and a graphical user interface (GUI). This project complies with the specific academic requirements for a grade of 5.0, including structured and clear coding practices, effective use of pointers, structures, dynamic data structures, and file-based operations.

## Project Timeline:
- **Start Date:** April 2, 2025  
- **End Date:** June 15, 2025

## Milestones:

### ðŸš© Milestone 1: Initial Project Setup & Modular Structure
**Due Date:** April 23, 2025
- [ ] Define detailed project specification and functional requirements (#Issue 1)
- [ ] Set up repository structure and initial modular framework in C (#Issue 2)
- [ ] Configure Makefile and compilation settings (#Issue 3)
- [ ] Design and implement initial data structures (structs, pointers) (#Issue 4)

### ðŸš© Milestone 2: Core Game Logic & File Handling
**Due Date:** May 14, 2025
- [ ] Implement the main game logic (move validation, game rules enforcement) (#Issue 5)
- [ ] Integrate dynamic memory management (linked lists, dynamic arrays, trees) for game state handling (#Issue 6)
- [ ] Develop file operations for game states, logs, and player statistics (saving/loading mechanisms) (#Issue 7)
- [ ] Perform rigorous debugging, memory-leak checking (valgrind), and preliminary testing (#Issue 8)

### ðŸš© Milestone 3: GUI Development & Enhanced User Interaction
**Due Date:** June 11, 2025
- [ ] Implement graphical user interface using libraries like Allegro, SFML, or SDL (#Issue 9)
- [ ] Introduce cursor-based interaction and graphical constraints on valid moves (#Issue 10)
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling (input validation, memory safety, exception handling) (#Issue 11)
- [ ] Integration, functional, and usability testing of GUI and core gameplay mechanics (#Issue 12)

### ðŸš© Final Submission
**Due Date:** June 15, 2025
- [ ] Refactor, finalize codebase for readability, maintainability, and efficiency (#Issue 13)
- [ ] Finalize documentation, commenting, and README updates (#Issue 14)
- [ ] Project submission via ekursy platform (#Issue 15)

## Technical and Academic Compliance:
This project explicitly aligns with requirements for obtaining a 5.0 grade:

- **Logical modularity** for ease of maintenance and scalability.
- **Advanced use of pointers and dynamic structures** to manage memory explicitly and efficiently.
- **Robust file-based functionality** to store game state and logs.
- **Comprehensive GUI** ensuring intuitive, interactive gameplay.
- **Detailed error handling** to produce resilient, secure software.

---

## Development and Contribution Guidelines:
- Clear and descriptive variable/function naming for readability.
- Modular implementation: each C file represents a specific module.
- Regular commits and pull requests, referencing specific issues (e.g., `#3 Modular architecture implemented`).
- Thorough documentation and inline comments.
